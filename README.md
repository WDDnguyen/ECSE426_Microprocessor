# McGill ECSE426 Microprocessor
Experiments from Winter 2017 semester <br> 
Used STM32F407 board for all laboratories <br>

Lab1 : Created a FIR filter using Assembly, C and DSP Library. <br>
Lab2 : Implemented 7-segment display for temperature using internal temperature sensor and board GPIOs. <br> 
Lab3 : Implemented connection with accelerometer through SPI and display roll and pitch value on 7-segment display <br>
Lab4 : Created multi threading program to use the various components from previous laboratories <br> 

Final Project : Used STM32f407 board to acquire Accelerometer values. <br> 
STM32f401RE Nucleo Board for UART connection and IDB04A1 BLE board to broadcast Nucleo device. <br>
Android Application used to connect with Nucleo board through BLE connection using GATT attributes and send data to/from Amazon Web Services.<br>
